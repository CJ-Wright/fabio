To make a mask test case:
  read some data into fit2d
  sketch out a mask as you like
  use "save mask" from the powder diffraction menu
  then go to keyboard interface
   ... type "fit" then enter
   ... type "trans" then enter
   ... type "exit" then enter
   ... hopefully you are back in the gui, if not, "exit" again

  then go to image processing, "exchange" and see the mask as a zeros and ones image
  save this in "klora" format and gzip it....
